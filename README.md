# VoiceControlledLamp

Implemented using the Arduino IDE and Arduino DUE microcontroller.

Created a voice-controlled lamp, using a geetech voice recognition module, 15 RGB LEDs, and an LDR resistor (along with a 440 ohm resistor). 
The lamp stores up to 15 commands for color and brightness change, it has auto dark detection that would turn it on when the room is dark 
and includes an RGB pattern mode.
